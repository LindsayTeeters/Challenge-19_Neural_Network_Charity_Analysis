# Overview
We are assisting Bek on her machine learning project for Alphabet Soup. We utilized Neural Networks to help Beks create a binary classifer to predict whether applicants will be successful. In this project we preprocessed the data. We then compiled, trained, and evaluated the model. Lastly, we optimized the model.

# Results
[x] <i>Data Preprocessing<i>
1) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? The targets for this model are located with the IS_SUCCESSFUL column
2) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? The variables that were considered are numerous columns from the data table. A couple of those columns are: Affiliation, Type, Classification, Status, and etc. 
3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?The columns that we removed were Name and EIN.
